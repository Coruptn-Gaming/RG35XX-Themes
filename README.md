# RetroArchTheme

Here is my RG35XX Custom Theme i made. Still needs a bit of improvements. But i figured i'd start sharing this with you guys. Thanks for the feedback!
Just copy and replace the skin folder under F:\CFW\skin and that's it. Alternatively, you could just delete your "skin" folder and replace it with mine from the zip to avoid step below.

NOTE: REMOVE PNG FILE CALLED "IC_SYSTEM-N.PNG" AFTER DROPPING AND REPLACING YOUR FILES.
THIS FILE PROVIDES THE GREY BG BEHIND THE CONSOLE ICONS IN CONSOLES MENU. MUCH CLEANER LOOK.
